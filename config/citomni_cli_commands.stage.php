 * PURPOSE:
 *   - This file is merged LAST into $this->app->commands
 *     when CITOMNI_ENVIRONMENT === 'stage'.
 *
 *   - Keep this as quiet and locked-down as production unless you
 *     explicitly want staging-only operational commands.
 *
 *   - Returning [] means "no staging-specific overrides".
 *     Empty does NOT nuke vendor/provider/base commands.
